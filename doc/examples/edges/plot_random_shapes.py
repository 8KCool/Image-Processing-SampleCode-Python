# We get back a tuple consisting of (1) the image with the generated shapes
# and (2) a list of label tuples with the kind of shape (e.g. circle, rectangle)
# and ((r0, r1), (c0, c1)) coordinates.

# shapes of any color. If we want the colors to be particularly light, we can
# set the min_pixel_intensity to a high value from the range [0,255].

# These shapes are well suited to test segmentation algorithms. Often, we want
# shapes to overlap to test the algorithm. This is also possible:
