===================================
Masked Normalized Cross-Correlation
===================================

In this example, we use the masked normalized cross-correlation to identify the relative shift
between two similar images containing invalid data.

In this case, the images cannot simply be masked before computing the cross-correlation, 
as the masks will influence the computation. The influence of the masks must be removed from
the cross-correlation, as is described in [1]_.

In this example, we register the translation between two images. However, one of the 
images has about 25% of the pixels which are corrupted.
