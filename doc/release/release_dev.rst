Announcement: scikit-image 0.X.0
================================

We're happy to announce the release of scikit-image v0.X.0!

scikit-image is an image processing toolbox for SciPy that includes algorithms
for segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation,
analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.

New Features
------------

- New options ``connectivity``, ``indices`` and ``allow_borders`` for
  ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``.local_minima``. #3022


Improvements
------------

- ``skivi`` is now using ``qtpy`` for Qt4/Qt5/PySide/PySide2 compatibility (a
  new optional dependency).
- Performance of ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``.local_minima`` was
  improved with a new Cython-based implementation. #3022


API Changes
-----------

- ``rectangular_grid`` now returns a tuple instead of a list to improve
  compatibility with NumPy 1.15.
- Parameter ``dynamic_range`` in ``skimage.measure.compare_psnr`` has been
  removed. Use parameter ``data_range`` instead.


Bugfixes
--------

- ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``skimage.morphology.local_minima``
  no longer raise an error if any dimension of the image is smaller 3 and
  the keyword ``allow_borders`` was false.
- ``skimage.morphology.local_maxima`` and ``skimage.morphology.local_minima``
  will return a boolean array instead of an array of 0s and 1s if the
  parameter ``indices`` was false.


Deprecations
------------

- Python 2 support has been dropped in the development version. Users of the
  development version should have Python >= 3.5.
- ``skimage.util.montage2d`` has been removed. Use ``skimage.util.montage`` instead.
- ``skimage.novice`` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.16.
- ``skimage.transform.resize`` and ``skimage.transform.rescale`` option
  ``anti_aliasing`` has been enabled by default.
- ``regionprops`` will use row-column coordinates in 0.16. You can start
  using them now with ``regionprops(..., coordinates='rc')``. You can silence
  warning messages, and retain the old behavior, with
  ``regionprops(..., coordinates='xy')``. However, that option will go away
  in 0.16 and result in an error. This change has a number of consequences.
  Specifically, the "orientation" region property will measure the
  anticlockwise angle from a *vertical* line, i.e. from the vector (1, 0) in
  row-column coordinates.
- ``skimage.morphology.remove_small_holes`` ``min_size`` argument is deprecated
  and will be removed in 0.16. Use ``area_threshold`` instead.
